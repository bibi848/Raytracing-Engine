# Raytracing-Engine

A repository for building a ray tracer from scratch, outputting images in a .ppm file, by Oscar Djuric

## Summary
This repository provides structures and classes which enable simple scenes to be set up, with objects and materials, to then be rendered by a virtual camera. The output images are in .ppm form which can then be viewed and exported as .jpg or .png on a desired software. I personally use DarkTable. 

This is an incomplete repository as it is a current ongoing project. Once approaching a closer stage of completion, I will update this readme file in a similar format to my Raytracing-w-soiling repository. 

Many thanks,
